# Beginning
## This is the start of Lambda Build projects!

Earlier this week, my cohort was preparing to kick off our first build project. We had to create a portfolio and blog about our findings.
This is where I'll be hosting my projects. I look forward to seeing how my builds end up looking like and my progress as I continue the course at Lambda!
